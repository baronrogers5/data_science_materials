# Machine Learning Basics

> Machine Learning is the art of learning insights from data, using a set of
algorithms and stats.
 It is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and has 
evolved considerably in the past decade.

## Types of ML

There are three main classes of machine learning algorithms:
1. Supervised Learning
    * Labelled Data 
    * Direct Feedback
    * Prediction of outcome/ failure

2. Unsupervised Learning
    * Unlabelled Data
    * No feedback
    * Finding patterns in the data

3. Reinforcement Learning
    * An agent who learns 
    * Reward System
    * Learn to accomplish series of actions
